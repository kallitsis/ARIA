# Contributing to ARIA

Contributions to ARIA are welcome! 

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
If you want to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the software license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [LICENSE](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using by opening an [issue](https://github.com/kallitsis/ARIA/issues)
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
