# **ARIA**: **AR**tificial **I**ntelligence for Sustainability **A**ssessment 

ARIA is a Python package designed to streamline the rapid calculation of environmental impacts based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. By leveraging Brightway2 as its core infrastructure and integrating AI-based search and refinement, ARIA automates many of the tedious manual steps in inventory analysisâ€”significantly reducing the time and expertise required for LCA studies.

## Overview

- **Automated Inventory Analysis:**  
  ARIA automatically matches user-supplied inputs with background datasets (e.g., from Ecoinvent) using natural language processing.
- **Brightway2 Integration:**  
  Provides a robust and reproducible LCA modelling environment.
- **AI-Powered Refinement:**  
  Uses the OpenAI API to generate search terms and select representaive background daasets based on detailed rules and contextual instructions.
- **Flexible Impact Assessment:**  
  Supports multiple LCIA methods (default: EF v3.1) to compute key environmental indicators such as global warming potential, acidification, and water use.
- **Visualisation:**  
  Generates plots and DataFrames for easy interpretation of results.
- **Modular Design:**  
  Structured into separate modules for project setup, data handling, search utilities, and processing, making it easy to extend and maintain.
